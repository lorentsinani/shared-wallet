# shared-wallet
Shared Wallet Project in Solidity

## Real-World Use-Case for this Project
ðŸ’¡ Allowance for Children per day/week/month to be able to spend a certain amount of funds.

ðŸ’¡ Employers give employees an allowance for their travel expenses.

ðŸ’¡ Businesses give contractors an allowance to spend a certain budget

## Usage

I suggest to use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy, test and play around with these contracts.

`Allowance.sol` contract is imported at `SharedWallet.sol` contract so you have to deploy `SharedWallet.sol` and you will be able to check its functionality.
